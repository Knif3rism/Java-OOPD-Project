This program is not fault tolerant

This program will take in a file in this format
[storage name], [capacity]
[storage name], [capacity]
[storage name], [capacity]

Meat,      [name], [cut],    [weight], [temp], [date], [packaging]
Grain,     [name], [type],   [vol],    [temp], [date], [packaging]
Fruit,     [name], [type],   [amt],    [temp], [date], [packaging]
Vegetable, [name], [weight], [temp],   [date], [packaging]

The first three lines define storage size, followed by a blank line and then the food in the inventory.
